GO + HTMX
===
I'm building a frontend with backend technologies because I'm a tired frontend developer who loves Go.

# Why?
What? Why? Do you don't like JS? or TS?
Yes, I like them, but I Like types and autocompletion and...
I don't like many comments in my code (JS Docs).
TypeScript is not secure at all... Maybe you can think that is, but no.

## You don't understand TypeScript, you are lazy, blah...

I love functional programming and the modern and crazy stuff. Yes, I love them, but... I work in a tech company building products... and the software as a product is long-term code, at some point outdated and complex to scale or migrate... And for that, I'm a tired developer who was reborn in the last months like a [Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/), and for that, I like the simple code, the explicit code, and the clear intentions.
In my experience, developers are complicated, and we make complex the most simple things; this is my new try to find the light at the end and build simple, faster, functional, and straightforward apps.
